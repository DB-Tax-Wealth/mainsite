Vehicle Expenses:</strong> If I have claimed vehicle expenses of any kind on any part of my return, I hereby certify that I have the required written log book to substantiate the business use/mileage claimed, and have furnished DB Tax &amp; Wealth with a written summary of that mileage from my log. I have adequate written receipts and records to support any actual expenses claimed. DB Tax &amp; Wealth has explained all of the record keeping requirements for vehicle expenses claims and also the consequences for failing to keep said records, including full or partial disallowance of the expenses which will result in additional taxes, interest and penalties.</p><p><strong>B. Businesses &amp; Rentals:</strong> If I have business or rental schedules on my return, I hereby certify that I have adequate books and records backed by written receipts, cancelled checks, bank statements, etc. to substantiate all income and expenses claimed and that I have furnished DB Tax &amp; Wealth with a written summary of income and expenses based on my books and records.

DB Tax &amp; Wealth has explained these requirements and the consequences for failing to keep such adequate records including full or partial disallowance of the gambling losses claimed and/or addition to income of unreported gambling winnings either of which will result in additional taxes, interest and penalties. DB Tax &amp; Wealth has provided me with an excerpt from Pub 529 pg.12 detailing the recordkeeping requirements, receipt of which is also acknowledged herewith.</p><p><strong>D. Charitable Contributions:</strong> I certify that DB Tax &amp; Wealth has explained to me the recordkeeping requirements for both cash and non-cash charitable contributions currently effective. These require written records for all cash donations and restrict deductions for certain non-cash items. I certify to DB Tax &amp; Wealth that I have such records and direct DB Tax &amp; Wealth to rely on this statement to claim these deductions. DB Tax &amp; Wealth has explained to me the consequences for failure to keep such records which may result in the full or partial disallowance of these deductions which would result in additional taxes, interest and penalties.</p><p><strong>E. DB Tax &amp; Wealth policy on return errors:</strong> If DB Tax &amp; Wealth makes an error on a return, as defined later, that will result in additional taxes, interest, or penalties to be assessed, it is our policy to file whatever correspondence or amended returns are needed to correct such error at no cost to the client, and to return the client to the monetary position that they would have been in had the error never occurred. Specifically this means that the client agrees to pay any additional taxes assessed, as they would have been owed anyway had the error not occurred. What would nothave been owed had the error had not occurred, is any interest or penalties assessed, and DB Tax &amp; Wealth agrees to reimburse the client for any such amounts up to the date that the error is discovered and corrected and, at the request of the client, to refund the return preparation cost to the client for the year of error. The client will bear responsibility for any interest or penalties beyond the date corrected due to failure to pay taxes due or refusal to file any needed corrective returns. An error by DB Tax &amp; Wealth specifically does NOT include the following; adjustments or disallowances involving failure to have adequate books and records of any kind, or unreported income; adjustments or disallowances of deductions, exemptions or credits based on facts and circumstances not proven to be known, or could not reasonably have been know by DB Tax &amp; Wealth at the time the return was prepared; retroactive tax law changes; any adjustments based on missing income not proven to have been provided to DB Tax &amp; Wealth at the time of return preparation as evidence by the DB Tax &amp; Wealth stamp on a reporting document.</p><p><strong>F. DB Tax &amp; Wealth policy on Audit/Letter Responses:</strong> Taxpayers acknowledge that there will be a base fee of $80 for responses to CP-2000, 566-B or similar letters including any required amended returns. This fee may be more in complex cases. This fee is waived if the response is needed due to a DB Tax &amp; Wealth error or an IRS error in processing. In person office audit representation will be billed on an hourly basis at the then current rates. I understand that I will be charged an additional fee if I request additional copies of any of my tax forms. Minimum of $25.</p><p><strong>G. Federal Tax Practitioner Privilege:</strong> On July 22, 1998 attorney-client privilege was granted to any federally authorized tax practitioner (Enrolled Agent or EA), authorized to practice before the IRS. Privileged communication can be comprised of an oral, written, nonverbal communication, made by or to a client, in confidence with the exception of disclosure. Exceptions to the attorney-client privilege rule includes business advice, pre-existing records, pre-existing documents, tax return preparation, billing, fees and any waiver of privilege. Privilege does not extend to any criminal proceeding before the IRS and any entity involved with tax shelters. Any and all information that a client provides to us, to prepare their individual tax return is NOT confidential. We are bound to provide this information, documentation and related tax returns to any federal government authority requesting such information from us.</p><em><p><strong>C.
