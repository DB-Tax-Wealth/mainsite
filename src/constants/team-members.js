While earning her Masters, Ashley worked at USBancorp as a Mutual Fund Administrator starting in June 2019. There she was able to gain deeper knowledge within the investment field and form relationships with advisors that specialize in Exchange Traded Funds. 

    In April 2021, Ashley left USBancorp in search of new, more growth-driven opportunities and DB Tax & Wealth was, and is, the best fit for that fulfillment. Ashley graduated with her Master’s in Business Administration and began her journey with DB Tax & Wealth in May 2021. She feels eager and motivated to use her past experience and academic knowledge to benefit her personal and professional goals, all while always assisting the company towards their bottom line.  
    
    Next, Ashley plans to strive within her Financial Analyst position and continue her education on the Certified Financial Planner track starting Fall 2021. Once completing her certification, her main focus is to ensure her work is to the best of her ability to benefit DB Tax & Wealth and grow within the company. 
    
    Ashley currently lives in Wheeling, IL with her boyfriend, Jake, and their dog, Ollie (Blue Heeler/Dalmatian). Ashley enjoys going to Schaumburg Boomers games, where Jake currently plays, visiting coffee shops and collecting Starbucks mugs from each state/location!`,
